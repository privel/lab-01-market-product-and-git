## Personal reflection

I chose the back-end engineer role because I am more interested in how applications work on the server side and how data is processed. At the moment, my skills match the market only at a basic level, since I understand the main concepts but lack deeper practical experience. Job postings show that employers expect strong knowledge of databases, APIs, and system scalability. I already have some experience with REST APIs and SQL, but I clearly need to improve these skills. This semester I would like to focus on learning microservices architecture and improving my database skills. These areas appear often in job requirements and are important for building real-world back-end systems. I believe that developing these skills during this semester is realistic and useful for my future career.
